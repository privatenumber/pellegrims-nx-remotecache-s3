# @pellegrims/nx-remotecache-s3

A task runner for [@nrwl/nx](https://nx.dev/react) that uses s3 storage as a remote cache. This enables all team members and CI servers to share a single cache. The concept and benefits of [computation caching](https://nx.dev/angular/guides/computation-caching) are explained in the NX documentation.

This package was built with [nx-remotecache-custom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx-remotecache-custom) ðŸ™Œ

## Setup

```
npm install --save-dev @pellegrims/nx-remotecache-s3
```

| Force Path Style | Optional. Whether to force path style URLs for S3 objects (e.g., `https://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/` instead of `https://<bucket>.s3.amazonaws.com/` | `NXCACHE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`    | `forcePathStyle` |
| Http Proxy       | Optional. Useful when your environment must connect to a proxy to access the internet.                                                                | `http_proxy` \|\| `HTTP_PROXY`   |                  |

| No Proxy         | Optional. Useful when your environment must connect to a proxy to access the internet, but is not needed for connecting to aws.                       | `no_proxy` \|\| `NO_PROXY`       |                  |

Authentication is handled by [@aws-sdk/credential-provider-node](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/modules/_aws_sdk_credential_provider_node.html), so credentials will be attempted to be found from the following sources (listed in order of precedence):

- Environment variables exposed via process.env (example: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
- SSO credentials from token cache
- Web identity token credentials
- Shared credentials and config ini files
- The EC2/ECS Instance Metadata Service

## Run it ðŸš€

Running tasks should now show the storage or retrieval from the remote cache:

## Advanced Configuration

See [nx-remotecache-custom](https://github.com/NiklasPor/nx-remotecache-custom#advanced-configuration) for more options like the ability to disable writes which may be useful if you only want to write to the cache from a CI but not localhost.

### Proxy Configuration

To use a proxy to connect to the S3 bucket, set any of the `http_proxy` `https_proxy` `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, with the lowercase version taking precedence. If needed, the proxy can be bypassed by adding the S3 endpoint to the `no_proxy` or `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

According to AWS, the `endpoint` and `region` parameters are meant to be mutually exclusive (though that isn't the case 100% of the time). Due to the complexity of creating a specific and valid s3 endpoint, and that there is no API provided by the aws-sdk libraries to generate one, this project handles checking the `no_proxy` for the s3 `endpoint` in the following manner.

If the s3 `endpoint` has been configured, it will be checked against the `no_proxy` and if found, s3 requests will bypass the proxy.

If the s3 `endpoint` has not been configured, it is assumed that the global s3 endpoint `s3.amazonaws.com` is being used, and the `no_proxy` will be checked for that url. Because of this, you could see the following behavior:

- If the s3 client does use the global s3 `endpoint` to make requests and if that url has been added to the `no_proxy`, then those requests will correctly bypass the proxy.
- If the s3 client does not use the global s3 `endpoint` (which could happen if a region other than us-east-1 is specified), and if that non global s3 `endpoint` has not been added to the `no_proxy`, then requests that should bypass the proxy will in fact NOT bypass the proxy. In this case, it is up to the user to determine which `endpoint` is being used and to add it to the `no_proxy`.

TIP: `no_proxy` is a global env variable. To limit the blast radius of `no_proxy`, include the specific service subdomain in the `no_proxy` entry; e.g. `s3.amazonaws.com` vs `amazonaws.com`.
